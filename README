You're Santa, it's Christmas, and you have 6 billion gifts to
deliver. Will you make it in time?

Drop a gift down every chimney, except the ones with smoke coming out
of them. The space bar drops a gift, and the arrow keys control
Rudolph.

This is a the original Python / PyGame game from 2002
ported to Javascript.

Requires a recent browser with good HTML 5 support. Sound works on
some browsers, but not in others.

You can play the game on: http://olemb.github.io/giftrun/
