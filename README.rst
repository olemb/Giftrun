You're Santa, it's Christmas, and you have 6 billion gifts to
deliver. Will you make it in time?

Drop a gift down every chimney, except the ones with smoke coming out
of them. The space bar drops a gift, and the arrow keys control
Rudolph.

This is a the original Python / PyGame game from 2002

Should work in any brower with HTML 5 support. Sound works on
some browsers, but not in others.
