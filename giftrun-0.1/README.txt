Gift Run
---------

You're Santa, it's Christmas, and you have 6 billion gifts to
deliver. Will you make it in time?

Drop a gift down every chimney, except the ones with smoke coming out
of them. The space bar drops a gift, and the arrow keys control
Rudolph.

Requires:

  Python 2.2    http://www.python.org/
  Pygame 1.5.3  http://www.pygame.org/

The graphics were created with the Gimp.

I created all the sounds for the game without blowing anything up.

The music was created with SoundTracker. I recorded the vocals (yes,
that's my voice) with the little built in microphone on my
notebook. The sound quality was awful, with lots of noise and a high
pitched whine from somewhere inside the computer, so I used Audacity
to clean them up a little. (Noise Removal rocks!)

Thanks to Kåre and Thilo for game testing and suggestions.
